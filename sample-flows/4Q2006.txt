IBM's effective tax rate in the fourth-quarter 2006 was 28.0 percent compared with 29.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005.

IBM ended 2006 with $10.7 billion of cash on hand and net cash provided from operations, excluding the year-to-year change in Global Financing receivables, was $15.3 billion - an increase of $2.2 billion from last year. The balance sheet remains strong, and the company is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities.

In December, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (SFAS 158), new accounting guidance related to pension and other postretirement plans released by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in September 2006. This accounting standard requires companies to recognize the funded status of their postretirement plans in the statement of financial position (or balance sheet). The funded status is measured as the difference between the value of pension plan assets and the company's benefit obligations to its current and retired employees. The adoption of SFAS 158 at December 31, 2006 reduced the company's assets by $9.2 billion, increased its liabilities by $0.3 billion and reduced stockholders' equity by $9.5 billion. These changes to the company's financial statements were non-cash and will have no impact on the company's existing debt covenants, credit ratings or financial flexibility.

Share repurchases totaled approximately $8.0 billion in 2006. The weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding in 2006 was 1.55 billion compared with 1.63 billion shares in 2005. As of December 31, 2006, there were 1.51 billion basic common shares outstanding.

Debt, including Global Financing, totaled $22.7 billion, compared with $22.6 billion at year-end 2005. From a management segment view, the non-global financing debt-to-capitalization ratio was 1.5 percent at the end of 2006, and Global Financing debt increased $1.8 billion from year-end 2005 to a total of $22.3 billion, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 6.9 to 1.
